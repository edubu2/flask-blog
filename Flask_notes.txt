Using Flask

Route Decorators (@app.route('/'))
  - these are what we type into our browsers use to go to different pages within a website
  - app.route decorators handle all the back-end stuff
    - allow us to write a function that returns the info that will be shown on our website for this specific route
    - the '/' is 'root', or basically the website's homepage


Running the Website from Local Machine
  - terminal
  - cd project folder where the python script with the flask app is
  - % export FLASK_APP=<python_script_name.py>
  - % flask run
    - the 'flask run' command starts the local server
    - open the returned ip from terminal in web browser to see the website
      - contains whatever is returned from the function within the '/' route director

Displaying changes in browser in real-time
  - by default, when you make changes to the script, you need to restart the server in terminal for the browser to reflect the changes
    - use control + c to shut down server then re-enter the 'flask run' command
  - we can set Flask to 'debug mode', which will display any saved changes to our file when we refresh the browser.
    - % export FLASK_DEBUG=1
    - % flask run
  - nice! now whenever we save changes to the python script, we can view them in the browser by refreshing the page
    - much better than having to restart the server for every change!
