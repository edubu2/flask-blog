We're nearing the end of our project. It's now time to break it up to be more modular.

In this video:
    - moving config variables into their own file 
    - move creation of application into it's own function
        - allows us to create different instances of our application
        - this is called 'application factory' - allows to have separate test app & production app

Split up our app into different sections
    - we use blueprints to do this

Creating Blueprint
    - example: let's make a blueprint for users/authentication functionality
    - create a directory within application package (flask_blog) called 'users'
    - also create one for 'posts' and 'main'
        - main will contain home & about pages
    - once each of these new folders have '__init__.py' files, they are now packages!
    - will make a routes.py file for each package
