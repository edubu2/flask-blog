We will use flask_bcrypt to hash passwords
  pip install flask-bcrypt

Run py3 in a terminal to see how this works.

Import Bcrypt class (from flask_bcrypt)
  - >>> from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
  - >>> bcrypt = Bcrypt()

Generate Hashed PWs
  - >>> bcrypt.generate_password_hash('testing')
    - returns a hash
    - this will generate a different hash every time we run it, but still works with password
    - can run in utf-8 with:
      - >>> bcrypt.generate_password_hash('testing').decode('utf-8')

Check Hashed Password vs. actual password:
  - >>> bcrypt.check_password_hash(hashed_pw, 'password')
    - returns False since that's not the right pw
  - >>> bcrypt.check_password_hash(hashed_pw, 'testing')
    - returns True since it's the correct password
