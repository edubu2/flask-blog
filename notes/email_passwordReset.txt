We want to set up a reset password process where an email is sent to user to reset password. 

What we will do:
  1. Generate secure time-sensitive token
    - to ensure that only a specific user can reset their password
  2. Send email w/ reset instructions

1. Generate time-sensitive token
  - use itsdangerous library
    - from itsdangerous import TimedJSONWebSignatureSerializer as Serializer
    - s = Serializer('secret_key', 30)
    - token = s.dumps({'user_id': 1}).decode('utf-8')
    - token
      - prints long random string
    - check if token is valid
      - s.loads(token)
  - for this project, we're going to update models.py
    - go to User model
