Corey Schafer Tutorial: virtualenv and why you should use virtual environments
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5vscPTWKOk&ab_channel=CoreySchafer

what is virtualenv?
  - a way to separate different python environments for different projects
  - why?
    - if you have multiple projects that all rely on a single package (like Flask)
      - may not want to upgrade flask, because it might break some of your websites!
      - maybe you only want to upgrade it for certain projects that you know will not break due to upgrade

creating virtual environments
  - we will be using virtualenv (python module)
    - virtualenv creates environments for python packages
    - as compared to conda, which can handle environments for different languages as well
  - terminal: pip install virtualenv
  - create an Environments folder where all of your environments are
    - for me this is in ewilens/doc/dev/Environments

creating first virtual env
  - terminal: cd Environments
  - $ virtualenv project1_env
    - this creates the new env 'project1_env'
    - automatically installs pup, setuptools, wheel
    - nothing else!
  - $ source project1_env/bin/activate
    - this activates our new environment
    - when we use this command, we're now in project1_env
